# Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis (Rule-Based)

This project analyzes customer feedback comments using simple Python rules to identify
whether each comment is **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.  
It does not use machine learning — only basic text processing and keyword matching —
making it easy to understand and suitable for entry-level analyst roles.
